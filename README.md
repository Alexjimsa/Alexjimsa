# Hi, Iâ€™m Alex ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **web developer** with a degree in **Geological Sciences (UCM)**. Iâ€™ve been into web development for a while, and during my geology degree I discovered the world of GIS and fell in love with it. Now Iâ€™m exploring how to bring both passions together.

Most of what youâ€™ll find here are learning projects, experiments and ideas Iâ€™m turning into code. Iâ€™m especially interested in frontend development and curious about how to apply it to **WebGIS**.

If youâ€™re into web, maps or curious about how they can work together, youâ€™ll probably enjoy what Iâ€™m building here.
