# Hi there, I'm Alex! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate junior frontend web developer with a growing interest in backend technologies. Currently diving into Ruby and exploring Ruby on Rails, with plans to tackle Node.js next. I also know Python and I'm a student of Geological Science at UCM (Universidad Complutense of Madrid).

### What I'm up to:
- ðŸ“š **Learning:** Ruby & Ruby on Rails
- ðŸ”¬ **Studying:** Geology (final year)

### My Passion:
I love to create and am excited about hopefully transforming my hobby into a full-time job in web development or another programming area.

Feel free to check out my repositories and follow along as I continue to learn and build!
